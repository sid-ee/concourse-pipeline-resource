# Concourse Pipeline Resource

Get and set concourse pipelines from concourse.

## Installing

Use this resource by adding the following to
the `resource_types` section of a pipeline config:

```yaml
---
resource_types:
- name: concourse-pipeline
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: concourse/concourse-pipeline-resource
```

See [concourse docs](https://concourse-ci.org/configuring-resource-types.html) for more details
on adding `resource_types` to a pipeline config.

## Source configuration

Check returns the versions of all pipelines. Configure as follows:

```yaml
---
resources:
- name: my-pipelines
  type: concourse-pipeline
  source:
    target: https://my-concourse.com
    insecure: "false"
    teams:
    - name: team-1
      username: some-user
      password: some-password
    - name: team-2
      username: other-user
      password: other-password
```

* `target`: *Optional.* URL of your concourse instance e.g. `https://my-concourse.com`.
  If not specified, the resource defaults to the `ATC_EXTERNAL_URL` environment variable,
  meaning it will always target the same concourse that created the container.

* `insecure`: *Optional.* Connect to Concourse insecurely - i.e. skip SSL validation.
  Must be a [boolean-parseable string](https://golang.org/pkg/strconv/#ParseBool).
  Defaults to "false" if not provided.

* `teams`: *Required.* At least one team must be provided, with the following parameters:

  * `name`: *Required.* Name of team.
    Equivalent of `-n team-name` in `fly login` command.

  * `username`: Basic auth username for logging in to the team.
    If this and `password` are blank, team must have no authentication configured.

  * `password`: Basic auth password for logging in to the team.
    If this and `username` are blank, team must have no authentication configured.

## `in`: Get the configuration of the pipelines

Get the config for each pipeline; write it to the local working directory (e.g.
`/tmp/build/get`) with the filename derived from the pipeline name and team name.

For example, if there are two pipelines `foo` and `bar` belonging to `team-1`
and `team-2` respectively, the config for the first will be written to
`team-1-foo.yml` and the second to `team-2-bar.yml`.

```yaml
---
resources:
- name: my-pipelines
  type: concourse-pipeline
  source: ...

jobs:
- name: download-my-pipelines
  plan:
  - get: my-pipelines
```

## `out`: Set the configuration of the pipelines

Set the configuration for each pipeline provided in the `params` section.

Configuration can be either static or dynamic.
Static configuration has the configuration fixed in the pipeline config file,
whereas dynamic configuration reads the pipeline configuration from the provided file.

One of either static or dynamic configuration must be provided; using both is not allowed.

### static

```yaml
---
resources:
- name: my-pipelines
  type: concourse-pipeline
  source:
    teams:
    - name: team-1

jobs:
- name: set-my-pipelines
  plan:
  - put: my-pipelines
    params:
      pipelines:
      - name: my-pipeline
        team: team-1
        config_file: path/to/config/file
        vars_files:
        - path/to/optional/vars/file/1
        - path/to/optional/vars/file/2
```

* `pipelines`: *Required.* Array of pipelines to configure.
Must be non-nil and non-empty. The structure of the `pipeline` object is as follows:

 - `name`: *Required.* Name of pipeline to be configured.
 Equivalent of `-p my-pipeline-name` in `fly set-pipeline` command.

 - `team`: *Required.* Name of the team to which the pipeline belongs.
 Equivalent of `-n my-team` in `fly login` command.
 Must match one of the `teams` provided in `source`.

 - `config_file`: *Required.* Location of config file.
 Equivalent of `-c some-config-file.yml` in `fly set-pipeline` command.

 - `vars_files`: *Optional.* Array of strings corresponding to files
 containing variables to be interpolated via `{{ }}` in `config_file`.
 Equivalent of `-l some-vars-file.yml` in `fly set-pipeline` command.

### dynamic

Resource configuration as above for Check, with the following job configuration:

```yaml
---
jobs:
- name: set-my-pipelines
  plan:
  - put: my-pipelines
    params:
      pipelines_file: path/to/pipelines/file
```

* `pipelines_file`: *Required.* Path to dynamic configuration file.
  The contents of this file should have the same structure as the
  static configuration above, but in a file.

## Developing

### Prerequisites

* golang is *required* - version 1.9.x is tested; earlier versions may also
  work.
* docker is *required* - version 17.06.x is tested; earlier versions may also
  work.

### Dependencies

Dependencies are vendored in the `vendor` directory, according to the
[golang 1.5 vendor experiment](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi7puWg7ZrLAhUN1WMKHeT4A7oQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgolang.org%2Fs%2Fgo15vendor&usg=AFQjCNEPCAjj1lnni5apHdA7rW0crWs7Zw).

#### Updating dependencies

Install [gvt](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt) and make sure it is available
in your $PATH, e.g.:

```
go get -u github.com/FiloSottile/gvt
```

To add a new dependency:
```
gvt fetch
```

To update an existing dependency to a specific version:

```
gvt delete <import_path>
gvt fetch -revision <revision_number> <import_path>
```

### Running the tests

Install the ginkgo executable with:

```
go get -u github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
```

The tests require a running Concourse configured with basic auth to test against.

Run the tests with the following command (optionally also setting `INSECURE=true`):

```
FLY_LOCATION=path/to/fly \
TARGET=https://my-concourse.com \
USERNAME=my-basic-auth-user \
PASSWORD=my-basic-auth-password \
./bin/test
```

or with the `Dockerfile`...

The tests have been embedded with the `Dockerfile`; ensuring that the testing
environment is consistent across any `docker` enabled platform. When the docker
image builds, the test are run inside the docker container, on failure they
will stop the build.

Run the tests with the following command:

```sh
docker build -t concourse-pipeline-resource .
```
